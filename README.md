# PrisonersDilemma
This repository houses the code for the final project for the course 60-371 Artificial Intelligence at the University of Windsor studied during the Winter semester of 2015. It simulates the playing of, and evaluates strategies used in, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma#The_iterated_prisoners.27_dilemma"> Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma </a> problem.

This project depends on the Weka API for its machine learning agent. Add weka.jar from the zip file to your classpath. <a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/downloading.html"> Download ere</a>.
